        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            To win the game you have to fulfill the following requirements:<br>
            * You have to buy all upgrades from the third upgrade slot so that the "Win"-Field appears.<br>
            * To activate it, all 9 fields need to have a grown carrot plantet on them at the same time.<br>
            * After that, you just have to click on the "Win"-Field.<br>
            <br>
            There are 9 fields where you can grow carrots, to do so you have to unlock (buy) them first. This costs a
            specific amount of coins depending on the field (left to right, top to bottom: 1, 10, 100, 1.000, 10.000,
            100.000, 1.000.000, 10.000.000 and 100.000.000 coins).<br>
            <br>
            After unlocking a field you can plant a seed for 3 coins which slowly grows into a carrot. As soon as the
            carrot is fully grown you can harvest it by clicking on the field. By clicking on the Sell-Button (the one
            below the Carrot and Coin counter) you can sell all your carrots at once for 5 coins each.<br>
            <br>
            The lootbox below the Sell-Button can be clicked every few seconds and gives you a random amount of coins or
            carrots between 0 and 9<br>
            <br>
            Below the 9 carrot fields there are 3 upgrade slots:<br>
            * The first upgrade increases the sell value of carrots.<br>
            * The second upgrade increases the amount of loot you gain from the lootbox.<br>
            * The third upgrade consists of unique upgrades which can only be bought in a limited amount. After you
            bought the final upgrade from this slot the "Win"-Field will appear here.<br>
            <br>
            The following unique upgrades are available <b>(Spoilers ahead!)</b>:<br>
            * Watering Can: Allowes you to speed up the growth of carrots by clicking on them. For each click the carrot
            grows by one stage.<br>
            * Lootbox Cool-down: Reduces the cooldown of the lootbox drastically.<br>
            * CarrotUp: Increases the amount of carrots that grow on a field by 2. This also works for fields where
            carrots are already growing!<br>
